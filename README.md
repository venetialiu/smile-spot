**Share moments of joy. See smiles around you.**

## What is Smile Spot?

Smile Spot is a full-stack web application that lets people capture smiley-shaped objects in their daily life and pin them on an interactive map. Upload a photo, geotag it, then explore other "smile spots" around you. Think of it like mapping small moments of happiness.

## Why I Built It

I believe that technology should feel human — systems that are approachable, meaningful, and encourage connection. Smile Spot was born out of a desire to combine creativity and user experience with technical skills to build something fun and positive. It taught me how to build real-time, geospatial features with secure authentication, while keeping the UX playful.
